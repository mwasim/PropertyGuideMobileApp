Business Layer (BL)
===================
Sometimes also called the Business Logic Layer (BLL), the BL contains entity definitions and
business logic.

Business Entities
-----------------
Business entities are classes that represent real-world objects. They're the core of 
Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP).

Manager Classes
---------------
In this particular architecture, we're using the façade pattern (lie we did with the DAL)
which is represented by static Manager classes. The manager classes are an abstraction on 
the DAl and SAL layers and perform any business logic.
